Survival is a text adventure game that appeared in the January 1982 issue of Creative Computing. It was a masterclass in how to construct an adventure in BASIC, and my fellow students used it as the basis for all sorts of offshoots.
The dialect is unknown, and if anyone can figure it out, I'd love to know. It has a couple of oddities:
1) strings are fixed width and have to be DIMmed, like Atari or Sinclair, but it also allows arrays of strings. And the syntax for this is... weird.
2) the function for extracting a substring is STR with no $, as opposed to MID$, SEG$ or SUB$. I have never come across STR like this before
3) you can, and the author does, use single quotes and double quotes for string constants. I have seen some dialects that allow this, but they are not at all common.
